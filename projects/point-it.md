Point It! is a database-backed web application using the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/).
Users can find where they are through the Google Maps API and add a point to mark off their favorite locations and categorize them as a restaurant, landmark, public area, etc.

In this project, I gained experience making database-backed web applications using PHP, MySQL, and the [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) development environment (with a dash of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
It was also the first time I used the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/).
This application was also a CRUD application where users can CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE entries.

The most important takeway from this project was learning about the different [HTTP Request](https://github.com/rmccue/Requests) types such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
Learning how to use HTTP Requests plays a large role in [REST](http://www.restapitutorial.com/) which stands for Representational State Transfer.
REST is used a lot in professional software development and knowing how to use basic HTTP Requests is definitely the first step into learning how to build a RESTful API.
