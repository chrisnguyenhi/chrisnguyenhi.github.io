This project or rather, "mission" was to create a LED Prom Sign to ask out a girl named Yumi to prom before prom contract agreements were due the following day. From this LED Prom Sign project, I learned how to apply basic geometry skills and papercraft to a real life problem under a limited amount of time-- Because literally, the prom contracts were due the day after. 

In addition, I acquired basic teamwork skills because I had to assemble a team of individuals under short-notice to trick her into going into my Chemistry teacher's classroom after her afterschool Student Government activities. 
It was also difficult to persuade my Chemistry teacher to stay afterschool till 5:00 PM to allow us to use her room but I made a compromise with her by voluntering to sign myself up for the 2014 Physics Olympics.

All of the supplies for this project were purchased at [Ben Franklin's Arts & Crafts](http://www.benfranklinhawaii.com/). The battery-powered LED Strings that were ran through paper boards to spell out "WILL YU BE MI Major Date TO PROM." This LED Prom Sign was an inexpensive option as it only cost less than $20 to make within a short period of time as opposed to my original idea of using candles (which would have gotten me a one-month suspension for setting fire on school property). My most important accomplishment in this project other than Yumi saying "Yes" was using wordplay by incorporating "YU" and "MI" in place of "WILL YOU BE MY Major Date TO PROM" on the LED Signs.
