Point It! is a database-backed web application using the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/). Users can find where they are through the Google Maps API and add a point to mark off their favorite locations or locations of interest. 

In this project, I gained experience making database-backed web applications using PHP, MySQL, and the [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) development environment (with a dash of HTML, CSS, and JS) for the first time as opposed to XHTML and J2EE which was taught in my ICS 321 (Data Storage and Retrieval) class. Additionally, it was also the first time I signed up to use the Google Maps API. 

This project was inspired by [MERCI](http://www.oceanit.com/products/merci), the mobile Geographical Information System (GIS) app I configured during my internship at [Oceanit](http://www.oceanit.com/) in the summer of 2015. The main difference is that this application is meant for everyday people to mark points of interests as opposed to emergency response units marking points to perform damage assessments.
