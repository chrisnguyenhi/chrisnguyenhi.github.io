Point It! is a database-backed web application using the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/). This application is powered by a mix of PHP and Javascript along with HTML/CSS for styling. Additonally, this application uses a MySQL database to store point data.

Users can find where they are through the Google Maps API and add a point to mark off their favorite locations or locations of interest. This application was inspired off of [MERCI](http://www.oceanit.com/products/merci), the mobile Geographical Information System (GIS) app that I configured to run the ArcGIS API during my summer internship at Oceanit Laboratories, Inc. in the summer of 2015. The main difference is that this application is meant for everyday people to mark points of interests as opposed to emergency response units marking points to perform damage assessments.

In this project, I gained experience making database-backed web applications using PHP and MySQL (with dashes of HTML and CSS) for the first time as opposed to XHTML, Java, and Derby which was taught in my ICS 321 (Data Storage and Retrieval) class. Additionally, it was also like I was doing real-life software development when I first signed up for the Google Maps API.
