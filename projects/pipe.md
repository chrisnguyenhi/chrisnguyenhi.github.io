P.I.P.E is an application that takes English langauge sentences and translates them into C for Botball robots. 
After a sentence is entered, the program translates the commands using a dictionary keywords associated with the [Botball C library](http://files.kipr.org/link/documentation/libkovan_docs/index.html) and creates a C file that is ready to run.
This project eventually won Best of Computer Science at the 2014 Honolulu District Science Fair and earned the Department of Information and Computer Sciences Award at the 2014 Hawaii State Science and Engineering Fair.

This was my first-ever programming project using the first programming language I learned. 
Now that I am I college junior, I feel that it was probably a bad idea for a high school junior to pick C++ as his first programming language (based off some Forbes article I found in 2013 about the top programming langauages to learn) but I am glad I did because it lead me to where I am today.

What drove me to create P.I.P.E was my desire to simplify programming for beginning programmers and through this I had my first experience with Natural Language Processing (a popular topic in Computer Science). I also wanted a cool demo with a robot at science fairs, so I decided to do something with robotics. 

Today, I am a proud Computer Science major at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and still continue to volunteer and mentor high school students for [Hawaii Science Fairs](http://www.hawaiiacademyofscience.org/).
