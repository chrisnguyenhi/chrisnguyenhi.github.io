Hi! My name is Christopher Nguyen from Honolulu, Hawaii. 
In my senior year of high school, I taught myself how to code because I needed a project to impress a girl at a science fair and now I am a Computer Science major! 
I am currently a third-year student at the University of Hawaii at Manoa majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Business Administration.
I identify myself as a teacher at heart, driven, and culturally-minded. 

One of my values is education, and as a teacher at heart, I have a passion for helping and educating others. 
As a STEM Resource Mentor, I have taught high school students how to code and pushed for more 21st century skills to be taught in the classrooms. 
This position has allowed to understand different learning styles and work with people of different age groups from students to teachers. 

My drive to succeed lies in my background. For 20 years, I lived in a public housing project in the town of Kalihi. 
In the presence of drugs and gangs-- the temptations that many people living in low-income areas succumb to-- I wanted to break the cycle of poverty. 
This goal drove me to work hard and as a result, I graduated as valedictorian of my high school, earned many scholarship awards and became the first member of my family to attend college. 
In 10 years, I envision myself as the success story of my town and prove to others that despite being the son of immigrant parents and coming from a social-economically disadvantaged background, anyone can succeed. 

As a resident of Hawaii, I have been exposed to different cultures and different ways of thinking. 
Living in a state that primarily composed of immigrants has given me experience in many languages such as Vietnamese, Japanese, and Korean. 
Being in a melting-pot of cultures has also taught me what is culturally acceptable in some cultures versus another and how to behave in different environments. 
I am always willing to connect with others and accept diversity. 

My skills and interests include software, teaching, and project management. 
I have a passion for creating software and seeing how technology impacts people and the world. 
I like Computer Science but what I like more is the opportunities it brings. 
In the future, I want to work at a company that resonates my values of education and pursue a career in Software Development and Project Management.
