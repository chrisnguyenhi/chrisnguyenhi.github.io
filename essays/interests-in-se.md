In my senior year of high school, I taught myself how to code because I needed a project to impress a girl at a science fair. Now I'm a Computer Science major.

## Who am I?
Hi! My name is Christopher Nguyen from Honolulu, Hawaii. My interests in Software Engineering lies in both front end development and back end development-- Full Stack. My software engineering experiences come from my internships at [Oceanit](http://www.oceanit.com/) and Ditto, a startup fund by the [Blue Startups Accelerator Program](http://bluestartups.com/). 

## What I do
At Oceanit, I had the opportunity to work on two mobile apps-- a CRM app and a GIS app. This taught me how to work with both front end and back end development as well as learn existing frameworks and a shared code base. For the CRM app, I had to use [Design Thinking](http://dschool.stanford.edu/dgift/), a human-centered approach to ensure that I create a product that serves consumer needs. At Ditto, I mainly worked on data analysis and front end development. Working at a startup can be intensive, especially with grueling deadlines and the pressure to meet adequete progress within a given period but it was an amazing experience that taught me about the "startup culture." 

I am currently a Network and Security Intern at Oceanit where I conduct high-level network assessments of external clients and state agencies. Although this position is not a Software Engineering position, I enjoy being able to take on a project management-like role and being able to interact with a variety of clients. I also acquired more experience in embedded systems with the 72" video wall system I created using Raspberry Pis.  

## What drives me?
One of my values is education and as a teacher at heart, I have a passion for helping and educating others. 
As a STEM Resource Mentor, I have taught high school students how to code and pushed for more 21st century skills to be taught in the classrooms. This position has allowed to understand different learning styles and work with people of different age groups from students to teachers. As a software engineer, I also hope to create software that can also assists others in their educational journey and continue to push for more Computer Science education at public schools in the future.

# Summing it all up
I have a passion for creating software and seeing how technology impacts people and the world. Before graduation in Spring 2018, I want to gain more software development experience, work with Machine Learning, and focus on building effective products.
I like Computer Science but what I like more is the opportunities it can bring. 
In the future, I want to work at a company that resonates my values of education and pursue a career in Software Development and Project Management.
