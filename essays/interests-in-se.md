In my senior year of high school, I taught myself how to code because I needed a project to impress a girl at a science fair and now I am a Computer Science major! Hi! My name is Christopher Nguyen from Honolulu, Hawaii. My interests in Software Engineering lies in both front end development and back end development-- Full Stack. 

After interning at [Oceanit](www.oceanit.com) and Ditto, a startup funded by the [Blue Startups Accelerator Program](http://bluestartups.com/). At Oceanit, I had the opportunity to work on two mobile apps-- a CRM app and a GIS app. 
This taught me how to work with both front end and back end development as well as learn existing frameworks and a shared
code based. For the CRM app, I had to use [Design Thinking](http://dschool.stanford.edu/dgift/), a human-centered approach to ensure that I create a product that serves consumer needs. At Ditto, I mainly worked on data analysis and front end development. Working at a startup can be intensive, especially with grueling deadlines and the pressure to meet adequete progress within a given period but it was an amazing experience that taught me about the "startup culture." 

I am currently a Network and Security Intern at Oceanit. Although this position is not a Software Engineering position, I enjoy being able to take on a project management-like position and being able to interact with a variety of clients. I also acquired more experience in embedded systems with the 72" video wall system I created using Raspberry Pis.  

One of my values is education and as a teacher at heart, I have a passion for helping and educating others. 
As a STEM Resource Mentor, I have taught high school students how to code and pushed for more 21st century skills to be taught in the classrooms. This position has allowed to understand different learning styles and work with people of different age groups from students to teachers. As a software engineer, I also hope to create software that can also assists others in their educational journey and push for more Computer Science education at public schools.

I have a passion for creating software and seeing how technology impacts people and the world. 
I like Computer Science but what I like more is the opportunities it brings. 
I hope to create collaborative software and build innovative solutions to everyday problems. In the future, I want to work at a company that resonates my values of education and pursue a career in Software Development and Project Management.
