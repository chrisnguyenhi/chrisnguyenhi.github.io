## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is an awesome programming language. At a glance, JavaScript sounds similar to Java, an object-oriented programming language but after doing a series of [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) lessons on JavaScript, I quickly found out that it is the most useful programming language in the field of Software Development. Millions of apps and websites use JavaScript as the main language to perform hundreds of functions like sending data or validating a request.

## Why JavaScript?

Every programmer chooses to use a specific language for a reason whether it their level of comfort or the open-source libraries available for a specific language, so I won't make the argument of why one is better than the other. What I will talk about is how JavaScript is different to me. 

One of key comparisons that people make with JavaScript with how different it is to Java. The first thing that sticks out to me is declaring variables.

In Java, declaring a string and an integer looks like this:
<br>
```
int myInt = 10;
String myString = "This is Java.";
```
<br>
While doing the same thing in JavaScript looks like this: 
<br>
```
let myInt = 10;
let myString = "This is JavaScript."
```
<br>
Notice how in Java, the variables need to be specified as a String and an int while in JavaScript, we can use let for both a string and an integer. As a programmer who started off with C and Java, this is mindblowing (though I guess the people who started off with [Fortran](http://www.fortran.com/) felt the same way when they first tried Java). 

In a way, being able to declare variables like this is pretty cool because it allows the programmer to skip the small details and focus on the logic of their code. The only thing they would have to worry about is whether or not their variables are ``const`` (constants) or not. As a side note, you'll probably see a lot of JavaScript code online using ``var`` as opposed to ``const`` or ``let`` and this is can end up with errors in the long run according to the [AirBnB JavaScript guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#types).

## JavaScript in ICS 314 (Software Engineering)

Although I have done work with JavaScript in the past by using several JavaScript-supported APIs, [ICS 314](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314s17/index.html) was my first time formally learning the language in a classroom setting. From my first week in the class, I learned how to do a lot of new things in JavaScript such as creating an object and accessing its properties. Being able to quickly add a property to an object without making a new one with new parameters was also something new to me. 

In ICS 314, there is a WOD (Work Out of the Day) every week where students are challenged to code a solution to a problem within a certain amount of time-- something known as "Athletic Software Engineering." I enjoy doing WODs because it is good practice for future interviews and it gives me practice in a programming language I am learning. This style of learning may be a little stressful but it is enjoyable because it challenges me to understand a problem and find the best optimal solution-- much like those problems found on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/draft/) which sometimes show up on actual tech interviews. 

## Conclusion: Is JavaScript Good or Bad?

JavaScript is pretty great. The best part of it to me is being able to easily declare variables and access properties inside an object. JavaScript also has a variety of different uses from web development to game development. I remember an IBM recruiter at a career fair telling me to put JavaScript before Java on my resume because a lot of companies nowadays are looking for JavaScript. From a Software Engineering perspective, I feel that JavaScript has room to grow. It is a great language that can interact with other languages such as PHP and HTML. From my knowledge, I can't see anyone progamming applications to do things like contour detection or train a classifer but it seems to be getting on that level since people are doing things like [binding OpenCV](https://github.com/peterbraden/node-opencv) or making a [Deep Learning library](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/). JavaScript is something I will definitely continue to learn.
