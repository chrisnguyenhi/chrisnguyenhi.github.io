Configuration management plays a large role in Software Engineering. It allows for collaboration and open-source development. [Github](https://github.com/) is a popular configuration management tool that has become industry standard. Github allows for online project hosting and includes many features such as a source-code browser, in-line editing, wikis, and more!

The best part about Github is that it allows students, professionals, and companies to display their work in a developer-friendly environment. Millions of software engineers and developers haved used Github in some way or form. It is also handy for students to use for online work. In a way its a cross between an online portfolio and "[Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) for Code" (not to be confused with [Google Project Hosting](https://code.google.com/projecthosting/) which kinda died out).

As someone who has used the configuration management in the form of Github for two years, I feel that Github is a very useful tool. During my sophomore year, when I was first introduced to Github and git in a professional environment at [Blue Startups](http://bluestartups.com/), I found that it was a very useful tool for me to collaborate with other software engineers, software developers, and a UI designer in my team. It also proved very handy in a scrum-agile development environment. 

Configuration management is pretty awesome. It allows anyone to work on their code from anywhere. I could be working in the US and push my code to Github and then work on it three weeks later in Vietnam. It's just that awesome. Because of Github's huge user base and its commitment to open-source development, it has become an industry standard. Nowadays, every resume has Github profile on it-- from seasoned professionals to young college students.
