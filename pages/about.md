Hi! I'm Chris from Honolulu, Hawaii!
I graduated the University of Hawaii at Manoa with a major in Computer Science and minor in Business with focuses in Software Development and Project Managment.
Prior to joining IBM in the Bay Area, I worked under the NASA Space Grant Fellowship program and interned at many Hawaii tech companies and startups.

Aside from software and project management, my passion is STEM advocation.
I believe that coding is a 21st century skill that everyone should have access to.
As a result, I served as a STEM mentor for the Hawaii Department of Education where I got to collab with some really cool teachers to develop Computer Science curricula and mentor students for the Honolulu District, Hawaii State, and Intel International Science Fairs.
