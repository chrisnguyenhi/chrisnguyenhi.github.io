Hi! I'm Chris from Honolulu, Hawaii!

Welcome to... Well, whatever this is. 

I graduated from the University of Hawai'i at Manoa with a major in Computer Science and minor in Business Adminstration. 
At UH, I primarily focused on coursework in the areas of Software Engineering and Technical Project Management.
I also got some cool security certificates from the NSA too (CNSSI-4012 and CNSSI-4013)

Prior to joining IBM in the Bay Area, I did a NASA project to find ice on the Moon (proven!) and interned at many Hawaii tech companies and startups.

A huge passion of mine is STEM advocation and education equality.
I believe that coding is a 21st century skill that everyone should have access to.
To do my part in this fight, I served as a STEM mentor for the Hawaii Department of Education where I worked with some really cool teachers to develop Computer Science curricula and mentor students for Science Fairs.

I'm a proud product of public housing and public education. I understand how difficult it is to create opportunity when the odds are against you. 
On the off-chance that someone who is of a similar background is reading this or stalking me, feel free to contact me on any of my links/social-medias. 
I'm always down to give advice and mentorship. I understand the struggle and understand the hustle 100%.
