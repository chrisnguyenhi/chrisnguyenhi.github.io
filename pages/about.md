Hi I'm Chris! I am senior at the University of Hawaii majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Business Administration. 
For the 2017 - 2018 school year, I'll be doing a research project under a NASA Space Grant Fellowship. I previously interned at IBM and Oceanit as a Software Developer. After graduation, I hope to become a Technical Program Manager or a Software Developer.

Since September 2014, I have also been serving as a STEM Mentor for a school complex in Hawaii. My emphasis as a STEM Mentor is early Computer Science education. Part of this role involves collaborating with teachers to develop a 21st century Computer Science curriculum. I have also mentored several students with Computer Science projects for the Honolulu District, Hawaii State, and Intel International Science and Engineering Fairs. 

My technical experience consists of internships at startups and large-sized companies.
Here are some highlights of my past work experiences: 

<li> Oceanit: Developed two cross-platform mobile applications with Design Thinking.
<li> Ditto: Developed a website with ~200 users while conducting consumer research and Google Analytics.
<li> Oceanit: Made a video-wall using six Raspberry Pis. 
<li> IBM: Developed a dependency detection microservice following scrum-agile.

I am currently a NASA Research Fellow working on creating a cloud-based service to host and process lunar temperature data from a spacecraft orbiting around the Moon. Originally it took 21 hours to read a day's worth of data-- I managed to slim it down to 10 hour so far...

My experience in the Tech industry and the Education industry has shown me how to apply my technical knowledge in all situations. After college, it is my desire to work in an environment where cross-functional coordination is used deliver value to consumers and end-users.
